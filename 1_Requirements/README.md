This Project is an Wiper control system,here a wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.It useful in the automotive unit the main purpose of the system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times. we are trying to simulate this project on stmcube 32 IDE.

* The location of the wiper is shown by an LED, which returns to its original position after cleaning the windsheet of a car.

* When the button is pressed once the car will start (Ignition key postion at ACC) When the button is pressed again the wiper will start(Wiper On) When the button is pressed again the wiper will off(Wiper Off) When the button is pressed thrice the car will stop(Ignition key position at Lock)

# SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

  1.No human interaction with car
  
  2.Manages all commands with one key automatically
  
### Weaknesses:
  
  1.Unable to monitor status of car
  
  2.Range is limited

  3.Wait for certain time after every command to press new command
  
### Opportunities:

   1.The Scope of this sytem is huge in automation or car control

   2.Less cost
   
   3.Changing lifesytle.
  
### Threats:

  1.When new command is given without completing the current command it will not take current command
  
  2.Rising competition.
  
###  Features:

  1.When the button is pressed once the car will start (Ignition key postion at ACC)
  2.When the button is pressed again the wiper will start(Wiper On)
  3.When the button is pressed again the wiper will off(Wiper Off)
  4.When the button is pressed thrice the car will stop(Ignition key position at Lock)
