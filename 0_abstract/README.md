A windshield wiper, also known as a wiper blade, is a device that cleans the front window of a car of rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, and water. Wipers are mounted on all heavy motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, railroad locomotives, and some aircraft.The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper. In spite of removing water from windscreen, this system also will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a Peripheral Interface Controller.
